 <p>Zoology (also known as animal science) is the branch of biology devoted to the study of animal life. It covers areas ranging from the structure of organisms to the subcellular unit of life. Some zoologists are interested in the biology of particular groups of animals.</p>

3.	Echinoderms are an example of vertebrates. (true or false)<br>
<p>Answer: False</p>
<p>Echinoderms are a phylum of marine invertebrates that include starfish, brittle stars, sea cucumbers, sea urchins, sand dollars, and crinoids.</p>

8.	Echinoderms have a radial symmetry. (true or false)<br>
<p>Answer: True</p>
<p>Echinoderms start as having bilateral symmetry as larvae. Once they reach adulthood they attain radial symmetry.</p>

9.	These animals have a closed circulatory system with a two-chambered heart.<br>
<p>Answer: A. Fishes</p>
<p>Fishes are gilled animals that have 2-chambered hearts. The 2-chambered heart is a simple organ that pumps blood for animals with gills and single circulation.</p>

10.	Aviary glands are specialized glands that produce milk. (true or false)<br>
<p>Answer: False</p>
<p>Aviary glands (also known as oil glands) are specialized glands that produce oil to provide water-proofing and maintenance of plumage brightness.</p>

11.	Reptiles have ultraviolet detectors to spot warm-bodied prey in the dark. (true or false)<br>
<p>Answer: False</p>
<p>(explanation)</p>
