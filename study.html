  <h3>Lesson 1. Zoology</h3>
  <p>Zoology (/zoʊˈɒlədʒi/) is the branch of biology that studies the animal kingdom, including the structure, embryology, evolution, classification, habits, and distribution of all animals, both living and extinct, and how they interact with their ecosystems. The term is derived from Ancient Greek ζῷον, zōion ('animal'), and λόγος, logos ('knowledge', 'study').</p>

  <h3>1.1. Vertebrates and Invertebrates</h3>
  <p><b>Vertebrate</b> zoology is the biological discipline that consists of the study of vertebrate animals, that is animals with a backbone, such as fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals.</p>

  <h4>Fish</h4>
  <p></p>

  <h4>Amphibians</h4>
  <p></p>

  <h4>Reptiles</h4>
  <p></p>

  <h4>Birds</h4>
  <p></p>

  <h4>Mammals</h4>
  <p></p>


  <p>The rest of the animal kingdom is dealt with by <b>invertebrate</b> zoology, a vast and very diverse group of animals that includes sponges, echinoderms, tunicates, worms, molluscs, arthropods and many other phyla, but single-celled organisms or protists are not usually included.</p>
